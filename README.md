# Hi there, I'm Jodi! 👋  

I am an active student at Muhammadiyah University of Yogyakarta, currently in my 5th semester. Welcome to my repository—where ideas come alive, fueled by caffeine, sleepless nights, and the occasional "Aha!" moment.

# 🚨 Hey, *Dear Friends and Fellow Code Pirates!* 🚨  

So, you’re here digging around my code, huh? That’s cool—I know we’re all trying to survive this student life. But before you *Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V* your way to greatness, let me drop some friendly reminders:  

1️⃣ **Shout me out!**  
   If this repo helps you crack the code (*literally*), just say something like, *"Yo, thanks Jodi for the inspiration! [link]"*. It’s free, easy, and makes me smile. 😄  

2️⃣ **Don't claim it as yours!**  
   Be real, be kind, and don’t act like you coded this masterpiece while sipping your iced coffee at Starbucks. That’s not cool. And trust me, karma’s got eyes everywhere.

### ⚠️ Why This Matters  
Look, I get it—sharing is caring. But copying without asking or acknowledging? That’s just rude. Plus, do you really want to be *that* person? 🙃

### 🤝 Want to Collaborate?  
If you’re stuck, need help, or just wanna share ideas, hit me up! I’m happy to help, brainstorm, or even debug that spaghetti code of yours. Just don’t steal my sweat and tears without asking, okay?
